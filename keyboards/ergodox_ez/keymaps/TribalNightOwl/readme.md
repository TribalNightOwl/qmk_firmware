# ErgoDox EZ TribalNightOwl configuration

It is based on the default configuration (QWERTY).

## Principles

Minimal movement to the outside of the pinky
Modifiers mostly on the thumb but available in multiple keys to facilitate certain combinations like ALT+TAB
Oneshot modifiers
Motion layer with access to common editing keys

### Motion layer
#### Left hand
Mouse movement
Mouse scroll wheel
Z,X,C,V keys available for use with CTRL for undo, cut, copy, paste (maybe I will use LCTL() in the future)
Delete, Backspace, TAB available for text corrections

#### Right hand
Cursor movement
Page Up, Page down, HOME, END
SHIFT, CTRL, ALT available for text selection and correction




These are the ideas I am considering:

## Implemented

## To-Do

* Uppercase letter and Spanish accented vowel
  1 tap = a
  2 tap = A
  long tap = á

  2 taps on all letters send uppercase?  Maybe won't work for cases where letter repeats, like:  letter, cannot, communication, 

  Maybe long tap = uppercase for all letters
  2 tap = acento en las vocales

  Maybe double tap but second tap hold produces accented vowel and forget about producing uppercase with tap dance

  Long press on n =ñ
  Double tap on ~ = ñ



* Multi tap symbols
1 tap = (
2 tap = [
3 tap = {

1 tap = '
2 tap = "
3 tap = `

1 tap = /
2 tap = |
3 tap = \

1 tap = .
2 tap = :

1 tap = ,
2 tap = ;
